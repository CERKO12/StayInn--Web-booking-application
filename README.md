Peer review by Zhiqian Zhang

Project Objective and Scope:
1. The objective is clearly defined and highlights the project's focus on delivering a seamless booking experience using modern web technologies like AJAX, React, and MongoDB.
2. The use of specific technologies is appropriately justified in terms of the benefits they bring to the project (e.g., smooth updates with AJAX, responsive UI with React).
3. The color palette is professional and the design is user-friendly.

Something You May Want to Improve:
1. You may want to fix the thumbnail in the Google Form submission since it shows a broken image now.
2. The deployed website link is very slow and took about 1 minute to show the actual website. You may want to check what's going on.
3. When I tried to register and/or log in on the deployed website, it seems that the buttons don't work.
